|exploit|['cve-2020-16875', 'cve-2020-1523', 'cve-2020-1440']|So CVE-2020-1523 and CVE-2020-1440 are actually powerful SSRF bugs and not just result in "tampering". Likewise CVE-2020-16875 is certainly NOT a memory corruption and I have a full working RCE exploit.  https://t.co/sAcdmv1QqD https://t.co/h2f0ZcaHV6 https://t.co/JHegDlI9pW|2|
|malware|['microsoft', 'cve-2020-0664', 'cve-2020-1245', 'cve-2020-0856', 'cve-2020-0941', 'cve-2020-1319', 'vert', 'window']|I have 1 Defense-in-depth and CVE-2020-1319 in Microsoft's September patch.

|exploit|['cve-2020-6326', 'cve-2020-6318', 'cve-2020-6313', 'cve-2020-6324', 'abap']|CVE-2020-6326 SAP NetWeaver (Knowledge Management), version-7.30,7.31,7.40,7.50, allows an authenticated attacker to create malicious links in the UI, when clicked by victim, will execute arbitrary java scripts thus extracting or modifying information o... https://t.co/g2qvhCU6l6|5|
|exploit|['diffie-hellman', 'cve-2020-1968']|CVE-2020-1968 The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result ... https://t.co/IU1ikmX8MN|1|

|breach|['cynet']|Cynet Takes Cyber Threat Protection Automation to the Next Level with Incident Engine https://t.co/PnOyGPNiEM We have all heard of the "cybersecurity skills gap" ‚Äî firms' inability to hire and retain high-level cybersecurity talent.  I see this gap manife https://t.co/lF76jAdAlV|8|
|vulnerability|['window', 'hyper-v', 'dll', 'system32', 'wd']|Uh, yeah... this is really bad. Any Windows system with Hyper-V enabled is vulnerable to trivial privilege escalation by allowing an unprivileged user to create a file called whatever they want, wherever they want. You want a file called WD.dll in system32?  Fine by me! https://t.co/xqqUPo6xhr https://t.co/9oFSQJPm24|2|

|vulnerability|['radius']|Bugs happen, but the security failure blast radius of a bug in any of these appliances is *huge*. *That* is the core problem. https://t.co/QloCY2PGd2|2|
|vulnerability|['notation']|1947: An error in the Mark II computer at Harvard University was due to a moth trapped in a relay.

|vulnerability|['unix']|This is supposedly well-known in the Unix community, but I think this is crazy. If you run scp on user-controlled filenames (think: backups, source code hosting, etc.), you are vulnerable to a pretty trivial RCE. There are no options to disable this behaviour. https://t.co/MJY4trCfsM|2|

|exploit|['near-zero']|My truly favorite standard quote is "we found no evidence of this issue being exploited in the wild". Such an empty idiom given most organizations' near-zero visibility or even willingness to investigate. I really want to see someone add a "We also did not look for any".|3|
